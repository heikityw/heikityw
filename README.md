# Hi, I'm Heiki!

I'm a 3D artist passionate about creating Blender addons and tutorials that make 3D rendering accessible and fun for everyone, especially beginners. My work focuses on simplifying the creative process in Blender, and I enjoy blending nature-inspired designs with practical workflows.

With a background in architectural drafting, I bring a structured yet creative approach to my projects. I'm currently developing tools to help others learn Blender easily and effectively.
